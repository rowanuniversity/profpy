# profpy.apis
## Overview
This module is an abstraction layer for accessing data from APIs with Python. As we use more of these APIs, we will update this documentation.
Each API will get its own class, which will be a child of the abstract class found in the utils/Api.py file. 

## Current APIs

- BlackBoard Learn API
- ServiceNow Table API
