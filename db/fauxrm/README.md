# profpy.db.fauxrm
fauxrm is a lightweight Oracle database abstraction layer for Python that provides a lot of the
functionality of traditional ORM's without the usual step of writing domain/model classes.
This library is meant to hopefully simplify tasks that involve basic record creation/modification,
whether it be an ETL batch job or a simple web application.

### Dependencies
The only non-native Python library needed to run fauxrm is [cx_Oracle](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/).
Information on installing this library can be found [here](http://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Note: The [Oracle Instant Client](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/instant-client/overview/index.html)
will need to be installed.<br><br><br>

## Quick Start
This is a brief quick start guide, for more information, see the [docs](./documentation/README.md).
